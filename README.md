# Weather App

is a simple react application (bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).), that aims to use front end tools such as:

sass: with the BEM method,

redux:  for the app store,
 
redux-thunk: to handle asynchronous calls,

jest: to test the app,

I also chose to use typescript for static data typing

## Installation

Use the package manager [yarn](https://https://yarnpkg.com/) to install node modules.

```bash
yarn install
```
